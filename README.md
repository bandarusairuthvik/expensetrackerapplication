This repository is for an Expense Tracker web application built with React. It features a landing page, user authentication (login and registration), profile and password updates, and tools to manage income/expense categories and transactions. Users can view income/expense data on a calendar, see monthly summaries, and visualize data through charts. The app also includes currency support, language selection (with locale files), and a sidebar with tools like a calculator. The project utilizes libraries like Prime React for UI components and React Hook Form for forms. It's designed for learning and includes custom templates, with setup instructions to run the app locally.
